# MachineLearning

This work was carried out for academic purposes of the "Universidad Comunera" or "UCOM" of the Subject Programming 2

This project is designed with a modular architecture that facilitates reuse and maintenance. We have used statistical metrics and machine learning models to predict home prices in an accurate and viewable way. The Streamlit application allows users to interact with the model and visualize the results intuitively and in real time, which is an advantage in predictive analysis applications.
